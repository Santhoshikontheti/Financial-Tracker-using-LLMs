## Budget Buddy:

Let me take you on a journey that led to the creation of Budget Buddy. This is a story about my quest to gain control over my finances and the challenges I faced along the way."I needed a tool that could not only track my expenses but also provide meaningful insights and help me make better financial decisions."

Budget Buddy is a personal finance tracker I've developed to manage my own expenses and income. It uses advanced technology, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to provide insights and recommendations. It enables users to track their budgets, categorize expenses, and set savings goals, all while keeping their data private and offline. The tool is user-friendly, customizable, and aims to simplify financial management for better control over personal finances.
### LLMs:
(LLMs) – advanced AI systems capable of understanding and generating human-like text. It struck me that these models could be the key to solving my financial management woes. By analyzing and categorizing my transactions automatically, LLMs could save me time and reduce errors."I ahve chosen few LLms to try and test which works well LLama based on  memory requirements like how much RAM we need in our laptop and few of them are 
### Phi3,Mistral and LLama2 Models.

## Building Budget Buddy
With this new knowledge, I set out to build Budget Buddy. I started by developing a prototype in Jupyter notebook, using CSV files to input my financial data. The LLMs processed these transactions, categorizing them and providing insights. To visualize the data, I used Plotly to create interactive and easy-to-understand charts and graphs.
Building Budget Buddy came with its own set of challenges. Ensuring data privacy was paramount, so I made sure all data processing happened locally within the Jupyter notebook. Accuracy was another concern – the LLMs needed to be trained with a diverse dataset to categorize transactions correctly. Lastly, building trust in AI-driven insights required transparency and consistent performance."

## Process :

1.Download  Bank Transactions and LLM
2.Data Cleaning(removing special characters and make it readable and easy to undertsand,removing duplicates)
3.Load the LLM 
4.Using prompting Techniques to LLM categorized teh transactions to 10 different categories.
5.Visualizing   i) Check Income & Expenses
               ii) Compare Expenses
              iii) Identifying Trends
